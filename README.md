VIDchain Technical Screening Exercises

### Exercice 1 - RNA Transcription
Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
- G -> C
- C -> G
- T -> A
- A -> U

### Exercice 2 - Accumulate
Implement the accumulate operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.
Given the collection of numbers:
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
And the operation:
square a number (x => x * x)
Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:
- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.
